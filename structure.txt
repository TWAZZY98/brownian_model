structure of the application

the purpose:
    create a stock prediction algorithm based on central mean theorem
        -take an input from the user to determine a time frame
        -take the mean of the closing price in that frame
        -calcualte the standard deviation
        -take the momentum of the price
        -create a probability distribution model to predict the chance of a certain closing price in the future
        -skew the model based on the momentum

extras:
    GUI:
        create a GUI that makes the data entry easier
        create graphs that show the probability of enetered price being higher that input
    Json:
        create a system that stores previous simulations to see how close they were to the real price
